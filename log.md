**Administration of UNIX-like Systems**
- The course deals with the skills required to administer a UNIX like
systems such as basic commands for working and navigating the system,
modify the operating system kernel, configure and modify a bootloader,
volume, process and user management.
- In addition to knowledge about the use of a UNIX-like system, the course deals 
even with the most common services used in a network, for example CIFS, NFS, email, DNSSEC and firewalls
 
**Thoughts**

I have had a great time diving into UNIX-like systems, even though I Windows has been my primary system for years and 
years. Using bash has opened a whole new world up for me, I can see my self making Linux my primary system.

**Databases - Modelling and Implementing**
- Different database systems
- Basic concepts
- Three-level architecture
- Relational model, relational algebra
- Orientation about object-oriented and the object relation model
- SQL, both simple and advanced
- Design of relational database and simple object relation databases using SQL
- Entity Relationship Models (ER)
- Extended Entity-Relationship (EER)
- Unified Modeling Language (UML)
- Normalization and functional dependencies
- Conversion of conceptual model to database schema
- Databases in Client / Server environment
- Transfer of an existing database from one environment to another
- Simple database programming
- Security
 
**Thoughts**

I have to say I like building databases, but damn there is so many parts to it.

**Computer Network**
- Overview: Briefly about the history, development and standardization of data communication. Different types of data communication protocols. Digitization. Circuit connection and packet switching. Detailed review of the OSI model and TCP / IP model layers. Infrastructure and communication technologies for local area networks (LANs), city networks (MAN) and global networks (WANs). 
- Physical layer: Different types of signals, attenuation, distortion and interference. Differences between analogue resp. digital signals. The bandwidth and bit rate of the transmission channel. Modulation and coding techniques for digital transmission. Multiplexing. Transmission media. Functions in different types of modems. Broadband access techniques.
- Data link layer: Framing, error handling, flow control. Local area networks (LAN). Topologies. Multi-access technicians. Ethernet. MAC addresses. Repeaters, hubs, bridges, switches. 
- Network layer: The IP protocol. IP addressing. Address types. Subnets and subnet masks. ARP. ICMP. DHCP. Router protocol.
- Transport layer: TCP and UDP protocols. Port numbers and sockets. Traffic jam management.
- Application layer: Client / server model. DNS. Application protocol. URLs.

**Thoughts**

This course has been fun and I think it would be beneficial to delve into this even more whenever I can.

**Object Based Programming in C++**
- Object-oriented terminology: class, members, operations, attributes, objects, instance, inheritance, relationship, message etc.
- Specification and implementation of classes in C++ 
- Overloading operators 
- Const declarations
- Abstract data types such as queue, stack and list
- Dynamic memory allocation 
- Pointers and its applications 
- Iterators in the standard library, including the connection to pointers
- Recursive algorithms
- Container classes in the standard library
- Own implementations of sorting and searching algorithms
- UML diagrams for classes, objects, activities and sequences

**Thoughts**

We are getting into C++ on a deeper level, and it seems that I am not that bad at it. Got a few compliments from my teacher so that makes me happy :)
