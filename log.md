**Mathematics, Algebra with and introduction to functions**
- Definition of, and basic properties of, the elementary functions.
- Mathematical notation and methods: logic and mathematical argumentation, set theory, consequences, sum / product signs and faculty. 
- Integer: divisibility, prime number, division rate and factorization and the induction axiom.
- Differences and equations.
- Absolute value. 
- Functions: injectivity, surjectivity, invertibility and composition.
- Complex numbers.
- Polynomial: the factor theorem, polynomial division.
- 
**Thoughts**
- I had a real hard time to keep up with math, has been a while. 
 
**Introduction to Programming**
- Design simpler C ++ programs based on procedural programming.
- Use available constructions for iteration and selection.
- Use the built-in types and applicable operators.
- Identify delimited program modules and implement these as functions.
- Use parameters to transfer data between different program modules.
- Use pseudocode to implement simple code snippets.
- Construct simpler algorithms.
- Describe and implement simpler algorithms for search and sorting corresponding standard templates in the standard library.
- Use certain class templates from the standard library for strings and collections,
- Use streams for line-based input and output from / to console and disk,
- Write simple building scripts.

**Thoughts**
I always through learning c++ is scary and yes it is but not impossible.

**Autumn 2020 University enrollment at Mid Sweden University, degree of Bachelor of Science with a major in Computer Engineering**

**Thoughts:**

Yes, about two weeks before program start I applied and somehow I got in. 
Have been thinking of getting into Computer Science for some time now, so I'm pretty excited for this.

1. Sed a aliquet sem, id `porta` lacus.
2. Nam ac orci vitae orci facilisis consequat sit amet id nibh. 
3. Suspendisse sit amet rhoncus velit.
- Praesent vestibulum vel diam sed convallis.
    - Nunc non urna ut diam
    - In pretium ultrices augueS
        - Ut semper consequat imperdiet

**Thoughts**: 
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed a aliquet sem, id porta lacus. Nam ac orci vitae orci facilisis consequat sit amet id nibh. Suspendisse sit amet rhoncus velit. Praesent vestibulum vel diam sed convallis. Nunc non urna ut diam aliquam viverra vel nec arcu. In pretium ultrices augue, sit amet bibendum purus pharetra sed. Nunc luctus diam ut est laoreet molestie. Suspendisse eget sagittis diam. Ut semper consequat imperdiet.
