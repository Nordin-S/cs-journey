**Mathematics, Discrete Mathematics**
- Theorem logic, logical reasoning and mathematical argumentation
- Equivalence relations, partitions
- Elementary number theory, divisibility, Euclid's algorithm, recursion, modular calculus
- Combinatorics
- Introduction to the complexity of algorithms
- Initial graph theory, e.g. simple graphs and elementary graph theoretical connections, trees and applications and digraphs.
- Some graph theoretical algorithms such as exciting trees and shortest paths.

**Introduction to Operating System**
- Basic concepts and history
- Construction and structure
- Processes and threads 
- Pseudo-parallel execution algorithms
- Memory management with virtual memory
- Communication with input and output units, file system
- Interrupt management
- Interprocess communication
- Synchronization mechanisms

**Thoughts**
This was a pretty challenging course but at the same time so much fun.
Apart from learning the ins and outs of computer hardware I also learned some scripting in both Linux and Windows.

**Mathematics, Algebra with and introduction to functions**
- Definition of, and basic properties of, the elementary functions.
- Mathematical notation and methods: logic and mathematical argumentation, set theory, consequences, sum / product signs and faculty. 
- Integer: divisibility, prime number, division rate and factorization and the induction axiom.
- Differences and equations.
- Absolute value. 
- Functions: injectivity, surjectivity, invertibility and composition.
- Complex numbers.
- Polynomial: the factor theorem, polynomial division.
- 
**Thoughts**
- I had a real hard time to keep up with math, has been a while. 
 
**Introduction to Programming**
- Design simpler C ++ programs based on procedural programming.
- Use available constructions for iteration and selection.
- Use the built-in types and applicable operators.
- Identify delimited program modules and implement these as functions.
- Use parameters to transfer data between different program modules.
- Use pseudocode to implement simple code snippets.
- Construct simpler algorithms.
- Describe and implement simpler algorithms for search and sorting corresponding standard templates in the standard library.
- Use certain class templates from the standard library for strings and collections,
- Use streams for line-based input and output from / to console and disk,
- Write simple building scripts.

**Thoughts**
I always through learning c++ is scary and yes it is but not impossible.

**Autumn 2020 University enrollment at Mid Sweden University, degree of Bachelor of Science with a major in Computer Engineering**

**Thoughts:**

Yes, about two weeks before program start I applied and somehow I got in. 
Have been thinking of getting into Computer Science for some time now, so I'm pretty excited for this.
